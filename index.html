    <h1">Hi</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Daniel, and I'm a software developer with a wide range of interests.
        I've worked on websites, podcasts and Windows apps, but I'm currently focused on learning web development.
        More broadly, design is a preoccupation of mine, and I'm always interested in exploring how
        people think about and interact with technology.

       the right fit. The majority of my work involved UX, design,
