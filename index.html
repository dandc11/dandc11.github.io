  <p>
    I'm Daniel, a junior software developer with a wide range of interests. I've worked on websites, podcasts and Windows apps,
    but front end web development is my primary focus. More broadly, design is a preoccupation of mine, and I'm always interested
    in exploring how people think about and interact with technology.

  <h2>A few things I've worked on include...</h2>
  <div class="container">
    <section class="col rotate-left">
      <h3>Give Back Memphis</h3>
      <p>
        I designed and deployed a site for this local nonprofit. Check it out.

      <h3>WordFeast</h3>
      <p>
        WordFeast is a side project I'm building to get better acquainted with ASP.NET Razor Pages apps. In essence, it's a readers' database with a nice interface, but it has a few other bells and whistles. Take a look.

        <p>Give Back Memphis is an organization that provides pro bono consulting to locol nonprofits. They needed a web presence
          that could communicate their vision and process, but one that was also in keeping with their local scale and spirit.

          After we determined that Wordpress was thier best option, I created a child theme. The coding on this project was rather light—mainly CSS and a little PHP—but 
          I learned a lot about UX and iterative design by going through the process with this client.

        <p>WordFeast is my attempt to build something similar to GoodReads, but with an emphasis on personal utility rather
          than social sharing. As an avid reader, it gave me a chance to build something exciting while expanding my knowledge
          of ASP.NET, C#, SQL Server, HTML, CSS, Javascript and using APIs. You can check out my progress in these short
          videos, or take a look on <a href="https://github.com/dandc11/BookDbApp" rel="github page">github</a>.
